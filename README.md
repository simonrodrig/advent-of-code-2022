# advent-of-code-2022
My solutions for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

## Deno
This branch is for my solutions written for (Deno)[https://deno.land], which is
a JavaScript/TypeScript alternative engine to Node.js. The main benefits of Deno
over something like Node is a comprehensive Standard Library, built-in
formatter, linter, task runner, and--most importantly--first-class support for
TypeScript, which is something you have to get around in Node by using something
like `ts-node`. Every script should include a `shebang` so you can run each of
the problems like any other script. Be sure to specify `--part=1` or `--part=2`
depending on which part you wish to solve.

## Branches
The [main](https://github.com/simonrodrig/advent-of-code-2022/tree/main) branch will most likely be TypeScript solutions. If I try out the challenges this year
in some new languages, they will be split across different branches.
