# advent-of-code-2022
My solutions for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

This is my branch for C solutions. Am I doing this for efficiency's sake? Am I
doing this because I hate myself? You decide!

## Branches
The [main](https://github.com/simonrodrig/advent-of-code-2022/tree/main) branch will most likely be TypeScript solutions. If I try out the challenges this year
in some new languages, they will be split across different branches.
