# advent-of-code-2022
My solutions for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

## NOTE
This branch was the original 
[main](https://github.com/simonrodrig/advent-of-code-2022/tree/main) branch for
Advent of Code, but I've since replaced it with Deno. Currently Deno has been a
much more convenient way to write these challenges, and I appreciate the ability
to execute each day as if it were a script. In this branch you'll find my
original solutions written for Node.js. All of these have since been ported to
Deno.

## Branches
The [main](https://github.com/simonrodrig/advent-of-code-2022/tree/main) branch 
will most likely be TypeScript solutions. If I try out the challenges this year
in some new languages, they will be split across different branches.
